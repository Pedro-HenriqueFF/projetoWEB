        LONG AGO, WHEN THE PYRAMIDS WERE STILL YOUNG, EGYPTIAN KINGS 
        PLAYED A GAME OF GREAT AND TERRIBLE POWER. BUT THESE SHADOW 
        GAMES ERUPTED INTO A WAR THAT THREATENED TO DESTROY THE ENTIRE 
        WORLD, UNTIL A BRAVE AND POWERFUL PHARAOH LOCKED THE MAGIC AWAY, 
        IMPRISONING IT IN THE MYSTICAL MILLENIUM ITEMS. NOW, FIVE 
        THOUSAND YEARS LATER, A BOY NAMED "YUGI" UNLOCKS THE SECRET 
        OF THE MILLINIUM PUZZLE. HE IS INFUSED WITH ANCIENT MAGICAL 
        ENERGIES, FOR DESTINY HAS CHOSEN HIM TO DEFEND THE WORLD FROM 
        THE RETURN OF THE SHADOW GAMES, JUST AS THE BRAVE PHARAOH DID, 
        FIVE THOUSAND YEARS AGO...

        In Yu-Gi-Oh, players draw cards from their respective decks 
        and take turns playing cards onto "the field." Each player 
        uses a deck containing forty to sixty cards, and an optional 
        "Extra Deck" of up to fifteen cards. There is also an optional 
        fifteen card side deck, which allows players to swap cards 
        from their main deck and/or extra deck between games. Players 
        are restricted to three of each card per deck and must follow 
        the Forbidden/Limited card list, which restricts selected 
        cards by Konami to be limited to two, one, or zero. Each 
        player starts with 8,000 "Life Points", with the main aim of 
        the game to use monster attacks and spells to reduce the 
        opponent's Life Points. The game ends upon reaching one of 
        the following conditions: A player loses if their Life Points 
        reaches zero. If both players reach zero Life Points at the 
        same time, the game ends in a draw. A player loses if they 
        are required to draw a card, but has no more cards to draw 
        in the Main Deck. Certain cards have special conditions which 
        trigger an automatic win or loss when its conditions are met 
        (e.g. having all five cards of Exodia the Forbidden One in 
        the hand or all five letters of the Destiny Board on the field). 
        A player can forfeit at any time.

        stop saying kaijus are going to be viable just because of mecha 
        thunder king and three slumber its hardly not I mean they brick 
        more then they can do also what if your opponent is playing 
        something that needs beat sticks just because of that revive 
        from mecha thunder doesn't mean much so three raigeki is nice 
        and all but the deck is like malefic you can only have one 
        of them at a time it would be nice. For them to get a card to 
        let multiple be on the field but that would make the deck really 
        good but malefic is getting really good support and making 
        them fun to play rather whining about get the 500th brick, in a 
        row so what saying it's becoming good means nothing all kaijus 
        do is remove stuff and beat things I like the deck but the style 
        is getting old and if mecha thunder king and three slumber is 
        there only saving grace I am not impressed very not impressed. 
        Its just not fun
